# RefineNet-Guide
I worked with RefineNet (see https://github.com/guosheng/refinenet if you're looking for the actual program) over the summer and if I ever come back to it I won't remember any of the problems I had or how to solve them. But hey. Maybe someone else might have these problems and doesn't want to spend as much time as I spent on it.
