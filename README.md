# RefineNet-Guide
For the summer of my junior year of college, I attended an REU program for computer vision and I worked with RefineNet (see https://github.com/guosheng/refinenet if you're looking for the actual program). If I ever come back to it I won't remember any of the problems I had or how to solve them. Alternatively: this is a guide for all the things I was searching that never existed because no one else had these problems and I feel like I might just waste my time again error handling and I kind of want to not do that ever again for this program.
